This is the source for the odcctools project, based on Apple's cctools
project.

The repository is set up to patch an existing tarball, using a
combination of patch files and copying brand new files.  To generate a
usable source directory based on a subversion checkout, run "./extract.sh".

The resulting source in "odcctools/" can be distributed and built on
a variety of platforms and OS versions.
